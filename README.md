# READMEgenerator

## Description
This guided README writer helps developers create a new markdown file using inquirer prompts answered directly in the integrated terminal. My goal was to create a program to simplify a crucial step in any project by dynamically generating a customizable README.md file.

## Installation
To install this project, clone the repository to your local machine and run 'node index.js' within the integrated terminal of VS code in order to answer the required information prompts and create your new file.

## Usage
After installation, answer the inquirer prompts by responding within the terminal to add to each section of your markdown file. After your answers, hit 'enter' to go to the next question. On prompts with multiple selection options, use the up and down arrows to toggle through the list and hit space bar to select your choices.
